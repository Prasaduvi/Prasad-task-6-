# Objective
The main objective of this task was to understand the factors that contribute to a strong password and to evaluate the strength of different passwords using online tools. This task helped in identifying best practices for creating secure passwords and understanding common vulnerabilities.

# Tools Used
* **passwordmeter.com**: An online free password strength checker used to test the strength of various created passwords.

# Approach
1.  **Password Creation:** Created multiple passwords with varying levels of complexity, incorporating:
    * Different lengths.
    * A mix of uppercase letters.
    * Lowercase letters.
    * Numbers.
    * Symbols.
2.  **Strength Testing:** Each password was tested on `passwordmeter.com`.
3.  **Score and Feedback Analysis:** Noted the percentage score, complexity rating, and the specific additions (bonuses) and deductions provided by the tool for each password.
4.  **Observation and Learning:** Analyzed what factors contributed to higher scores and what led to deductions, thereby identifying characteristics of strong vs. weak passwords.

# Screenshots

The following screenshots illustrate the password strength evaluation:

* `screencapture-passwordmeter-2025-07-01-11_50_07.jpg`: Evaluation of a basic password (`password123`).
* `screencapture-passwordmeter-2025-07-01-11_52_06.jpg`: Evaluation of a moderately strong password (`MyPassWd23`).
* `screencapture-passwordmeter-2025-07-01-11_53_54.jpg`: Evaluation of a very strong and complex password (`3L!@Mb#sCLub%N^T(~t)`).

# Key Learnings & Best Practices

Through this exercise, the following key insights and best practices for creating strong passwords were reinforced:

* **Length is Crucial:** Longer passwords generally provide significantly better security.
* **Character Variety:** Combining uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols dramatically increases password strength.
* **Avoid Common Patterns:** Steer clear of sequential characters (e.g., `123`, `abc`), repeated characters, dictionary words, and personal information.
* **Randomness:** Truly random passwords are the strongest. Consider using passphrases (long sentences) or password generator tools.
* **Uniqueness:** Do not reuse passwords across multiple accounts to prevent credential stuffing attacks.
* **Regular Updates:** While less emphasized now than unique passwords, periodically changing passwords, especially for sensitive accounts, can add a layer of security.

## Summary of Results

The evaluation clearly showed a direct correlation between password complexity and its strength score.
* A simple, common password like `password123` scored low (43%) due to its predictability and lack of character variety.
* Introducing a mix of cases, numbers, and a symbol (`MyPassWd23`) significantly boosted the score to 89%.
* A long, highly randomized password incorporating all character types (`3L!@Mb#sCLub%N^T(~t)`) achieved a perfect 100% score, demonstrating optimal strength.

This task effectively illustrated that strong passwords are long, random, and utilize a diverse set of characters, making them difficult to guess or crack through common attack methods.
